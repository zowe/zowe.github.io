    question: What is the “official” date of Zowe V2 LTS? 
    answer: |
      
      The official date is TBD, the target is April 25, 2022; look for the official announcement at [Zowe.org](/) landing page announcement banner.
      
      We are sorry for the delay and any inconvenience coming out of it. 
  - number: 2
    question: Where can I find the current (V1) and new (V2) LTS conformance criteria?
    answer: |
      
      The Zowe Squads have prepared XLS spreadsheets with conformance criteria for all Zowe
      extensions including: CLI, APIs, App Framework, and Explorerfor VS Code. The spreadsheets clearly show the prior /
      V1 criteria alongside the new / V2 criteria. Please be aware, there are additions, deletions, and CHANGES to the
      criteria. In some cases the change is simply that a BEST PRACTICE has been deemed REQUIRED. Use the light-GREEN
      highlights to easily identify the changes. See the [Changes to the Conformance Criteria](#conformance-changes) section at [Zowe.org/vNext](/vNext).
  - number: 3
    question: Will my V1 conformant extension automatically work with V2?
    answer: |
      
      NO. We recommend testing all V1 conformant extensions. See the [Coming changes (For Users)](#coming-changes) section at
      [Zowe.org/vNext](/vNext).

  - number: 4
    question: What if my extension does not work with Zowe V2?
    answer: |
      
      See the recommendations in the [Coming changes](#coming-changes) section at [Zowe.org/vNext](/vNext).

  - number: 5
    question: How can I test my current plug-in and/or extension with Zowe V2?
    answer: |
      
      Obtain the Zowe V2 LTS release
  
  - number: 6
    question: Do I need to reapply for conformance?
    answer: |
      
      YES, we expect the Zowe V2 Conformance program to be available in early Feb 2022. We will
      announce when extenders can pre-apply in the [LATEST ANNOUNCEMENTS](#latest-announcements) section at [Zowe.org/vNext](/vNext).

  - number: 7
    question: What happens to my V1 conformance badge?
    answer: |
      
      All Zowe V1 conformance badges will remain at the Open Mainframe Project Interactive
      Landscape; we recommend documenting a Zowe compatibility matrix to ensure clients are aware of any/all
      compatibility issues between your V1 conformant apps and Zowe V2.

  - number: 8
    question: Will I be able to pre-apply for Zowe V2 conformance?
    answer: |
      
      Yes, We will announce when extenders can pre-apply in the [LATEST ANNOUNCEMENTS](#latest-announcements) section at 
        [Zowe.org/vNext](/vNext).

  - number: 9
    question: When can I share this information with my customers?
    answer: |
      
      Anytime. Zowe is an open source project managed by a transparent, open source community.

  - number: 10
    question: How long will V1 LTS be supported?
    answer: |
      
      The V1 LTS Maintenance timeline runs through July 2024. See RELEASE TIMELINE at [Zowe.org/download](download.html).

  - number: 11
    question: What if my extension does not qualify for V2 conformance?
    answer: |
      
      You have several options:

      - Notify your customer base and advise them to remain on Zowe V1 LTS until
      you are able to make the necessary modifications to satisfy all of the new requirements (Note: extenders can
      choose NOT to be “day-1” V2 conformant )
      - Notify your customer base of V2 compatibility concerns (or lack thereof)
      and advise accordingly (e.g. extension operates but will not leverage V2 features etc.)
      - Replace your extension with a V2 conformant extension and indicate it as
      such

  - number: 12
    question: Where can I go for more information or get interactive help? (my question is not listed here)
    answer: |
      
      You have several options:

      - Attend one (or more) of the (7) bi-weekly Zowe V2 OFFICE HOURS meetings
      offered on Wednesdays at 12pm ET. Kickoff is scheduled for 12/8. Following (6) meetings are scheduled for: 1/05,
      1/12, 1/19, 1/26, 2/2, 2/23 There are 2 more optional meetings plannes for 2/9, 2/16
      - Interact with a Zowe Community Member via SLACK. Click on the COMMUNITY tab
      at Zowe.org, navigate to the SLACK box and click #zowe-onboarding
      - Join a Zowe Squad call. Click on the COMMUNITY tab at zowe.org, navigate
      to the JOIN A SQUAD CALL section on this page. Click on one of the calendar entries for Zoom meeting links.

  - number: 13
    question: Will the Zowe V2 Office Hours be recorded? (How do I find the recording?)
    answer: |
      
      Yes. Recordings can be provided on request. Click on the COMMUNITY tab at [Zowe.org](https://zowe.org), navigate to the SLACK box
      and click #zowe-onboarding and request the recording.

  - number: 14
    question: Will there be a means to migrate (or convert?) existing / old-style profiles to the V2 team config for Zowe CLI? Will it handle profiles that are secured by SCS?
    answer: |
      
      Yes, we plan to introduce a "zowe config convert-profiles" command, which will be available in the v2 release.

  - number: 15
    question: Will (CLI)Daemon mode be integrated seamlessly into v2 and enabled by default?
    answer: |
      
      This work is still in progress-we are working on a "zowe daemon enable" command to make the daemon installation process as seamless as possible. Daemon mode will be disabled by default, the command must be run to enable it.

  - number: 16
    question: The V1 version of Zowe Explorer offers a text input area, where a user can enter some of the data / attributes (host, port, etc.) necessary to create the old-style profiles.  With Team Config what options are available for users to edit the config file?  Is it manual? Is there a UI?
    answer: |
      
      The recommended approach for editing the config file is to launch it in VS Code from Zowe Explorer and make modifications there. The designated user responsible for creating and maintaining the config (we recommend a team lead or Administrator) will be able to leverage the built-in “intellisense” when editing the file. *Note: **Team Config fundamentally changes the paradigm on profile creation & management.** Prior to Team Config, **all users** were required to understand, create, test, trouble-shoot, and manage their own profiles. Team Config was designed to scale all of these tasks back, remove the burden from individual users and centralize it. Once the config is distributed most users should not need to make any significant edits.*

   - name: Zowe CLI Office Hours Frequently Asked Questions
     id: questions-cli
     questions: 
       - number: 1
         question: Will daemon mode pre-load profiles?
         answer: |
           
           No, team config will be reloaded for every command

       - number: 2
         question: Will it be possible to override the built-in Secure Credentials if you are using something else?
         answer: |
           
           Team Config will likely support alternates defined in the settings json file, administrators will probably need to hand-edit the configuration file to set a new credential manager

       - number: 3
         question: How do you expect consumers to migrate from the (V1) old Secure Credentials to the new (V2 team config) configuration? Is there a migration process?
         answer: |
           
           A migration utility is available - it will translate profiles (1 for 1) to new  (team config) format AND (optionally) clean-up old profiles and old SCS entries.

       - number: 4
         question: Is migration to the new profile format required?
         answer: |
           
           Migration to the new profile format is NOT required immediately - the old profiles will work UNLESS a team config is created - that said, the old profiles will not be used if a new team config is available. Simply stated - if a team config is not located, CLI will fall back to using the prior profiles

       - number: 5
         question: Will V2 be able to use the old (V1) Secure Credentials?
         answer: |
           
           Yes - CLI can read the old and the new format

       - number: 6
         question: Will my username/password be saved in 2 different locations if I do not use the --delete (after the migration)?
         answer: |
           
           Yes (recommend this is cleaned up)

       - number: 7
         question: For the keyword base-path, does it remain camel case or transition to something else?
         answer: |
           
           CLI option name is "base-path", property name in config is "basePath"

       - number: 1
         question: Does the Service ID apply to zlux as well?
         answer: |
           
           Yes

       - number: 2
         question: Is the “BCM” prefix for Broadcom required for V2 or can we continue to use "CA"?
         answer: |
           
           The BCM prefix for V2 is required

       - number: 3
         question: For SSO - basic authentication, is switching to JWT tokens required for conformance or is it considered a best practice?
         answer: |
           
           Yes, this a requirement for V2 conformance, however Pass Tickets can be used and it is possible to leverage the basic authentication to properly participate. The configuration is here: [https://docs.zowe.org/stable/extend/extend-apiml/api-mediation-passtickets/#api-services-that-support-passtickets](https://docs.zowe.org/stable/extend/extend-apiml/api-mediation-passtickets/#api-services-that-support-passtickets) *The API ML will issue a passticket for the user when service is accessed as long as the user provides a valid JWT token. We recommend this route (minimally) to give the users a seamless signon experience.*

       - number: 4
         question: Will Pass Tickets continue to work?
         answer: |
           
           Yes

       - number: 5
         question: Where is the API ID field located, is it ID in the manifest.yaml?
         answer: |
           
           It is part of your configuration yaml - it is a unique identifier for your service that helps to identify your service and uses the format: *companyprefix.productname* (Note: it is used for documentation only, has no impact on interacting with API-ML)

       - number: 6
         question: Can you use the same API ID name for different instances of your service?
         answer: |
           
           Yes

       - number: 7
         question: Can you use the same API ID name for different instances of your service?
         answer: |
           
           Cross-version compatibility may be possible but is not guarenteed; recommend upgrading both

       - number: 8
         question: Will the V2 Mediation Layer will require V2 APIs or will it work with existing (V1) APIs?
         answer: |
           
           Existing (V1) APIs will continue to work

   - name: Zowe Explorers Office Hours Frequently Asked Questions
     id: questions-explorers
     questions: 
       - number: 1
         question: Will Zowe Explorer function properly if you do not want to leverage the Zowe credential manager? (Secure Credential Store)?
         answer: |
           
           Yes

       - number: 2
         question: Will Zowe Explorer (V2) require the installation of Zowe CLI (V2) for any features?
         answer: |
           
           No. Zowe CLI offers more robust functionality for Team Configuration initialization specifically when configuring for MFA/token support, however it is NOT required. Zowe Explorer users interested in configuring for MFA/Tokens can manually update their Team Configuration

       - number: 3
         question: Will consumers need to change the way they obtain new releases of Zowe Explorer from the VS Code Marketplace in order to obtain the Zowe V2 version?
         answer: |
           
           No. The Zowe Explorer download experience will not change.

       - number: 4
         question: Will my existing Zowe Explorer profiles be updated to the new format automatically when I download Zowe Explorer V2?
         answer: |
           
           No. Users must plan to convert to the Team Configuration (profiles) format.

       - number: 5
         question: Will my existing (yaml) Zowe Explorer profiles continue to work with V2 and subsequent Zowe releases? Is the same true for Zowe CLI profiles?
         answer: |
           
           The V1-style profiles will remain backward compatible for the duration of the Zowe V2 ACTIVE and MAINTENANCE time period (~4 years), however they will be identified as “deprecated” in Zowe V2 which means they will not be backwards compatible with Zowe V3 and beyond. The same is true for Zowe CLI profiles.

       - number: 6
         question: What if a user has both the V1-style profiles and the V2 Team Configuration?
         answer: |
           
           The presence of a Team Configuration renders all V1 profiles unusable. When you opt in to the V2 Team configuration, you cannot revert back.

       - number: 7
         question: Can I create or update V1-style profiles in Zowe Explorer V2?
         answer: |
           
           Yes, as long as there is no team config file present.           

       - number: 8
         question: How will a user know what type of profiles they are using?
         answer: |
           
           Zowe Explorer users may not know. In the CLI, if a V2 profile is found, and a V1 profiles command is issued, an error similar to the following will be displayed:

           -> zowe profiles list zosmf.  
           An error occurred trying to list profiles.  
           'Profile IO Error: A Zowe V1 profile operation was attempted with a Zowe V2 configuration in use.'

           'Warning: The command 'profiles list' is deprecated.'  
           "Recommended replacement: The 'config list' command"

           'If only V1 profiles exist, the command will work, but a deprecation warning will be displayed:'

           -> zowe profiles list zosmf  
           sys1_zosmf  
           sys2_zosmf (default)  
           sys3_zosmf

           "Warning: The command 'profiles list' is deprecated."  
           "Recommended replacement: The 'config list' command"

       - number: 9
         question: Is there a profile conversion utility available?
         answer: |
           
           Yes, the CLI has a conversion utility.  At the present time, Zowe Explorer users who wish to convert over and do not use Zowe CLI will need to create their profiles from scratch OR install Zowe CLI and use the Zowe CLI conversion utility.

       - number: 10
         question: Where can a user obtain / download Zowe Explorer?
         answer: |
           
           Zowe Explorer is available for download at the VisualStudio Marketplace: 
           [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zowe.vscode-extension-for-zowe](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zowe.vscode-extension-for-zowe)
           and the Open VSX Registry: 
           [https://open-vsx.org/extension/Zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe](https://open-vsx.org/extension/Zowe/vscode-extension-for-zowe)

       - number: 11
         question: Will the Zowe V2 JSON schema get populated with the appropriate configuration information for a given extension like the V1 META.YAML file gets updated - i.e. whenever a user installs a conformant Zowe extension?
         answer: |
           
           For Zowe CLI Extensions: the JSON schema file is automatically updated when a Zowe CLI plug-in is installed; more specifically the global schema is dynamically updated -- individual project schemas are not). For Zowe Explorer Extensions: we have plans to automatically insert configuration information into the schema, but at the current time this information will need to be manually added.

       - number: 12
         question: What if I install a new plug-in after initializing my Team Configuration?  How do I ensure the configuration has the new plug-in information?
         answer: |
           
           For Zowe CLI, the global schema is updated when the new plug-in is installed. New init commands will include the new plug-in profile(s) in the generated zowe.config.json. Project-level schema is not updated at plug-in install time. To update, run zowe config update-schemas. The plan for Zowe Explorer is similar but is still being discussed.

       - number: 13
         question: Does the base schema allow me to add my own set of properties?
         answer: |
           
           Yes.

       - number: 1
         question: Will we be able to specify individual ports rather than initial+offset? We have a funky pattern we're using.
         answer: |
           
           Yes, specifying individual ports will continue to be supported

       - number: 2
         question: Can the zwe components install command be executed in a batch job, too?
         answer: |
           
           Yes, should be able to run via SHELL or via a batch job

       - number: 3
         question: If ZWE_LAUNCH_COMPONENTS is a list of all components, does the zwe components install command handle whether to add a new component to that ZWE_LAUNCH_COMPONENTS variable as necessary?
         answer: |
           
           Most-likely, yes (will need to be confirmed)

       - number: 4
         question: Does the zwe components install command also handle ZIS and ZSS components?
         answer: |
           
           Yes

       - number: 5
         question: Where is zowe.yaml located if the instance directory (where it used to be) no longer exists?
         answer: |
           
           Zowe.yaml is a centralized file containing parameters utilized by the ZWE command - you determine where it resides. V2 no longer requires an instance directory.

       - number: 6
         question: Is there a Zowe preview build available yet?
         answer: |

     id: questions-systems
     questions: 
       - number: 1
         question: The workspaceDirectory example (screen shot in the presentation) had the word "instance" in the path. Is that deliberate?
         answer: |
           
           NO, that is an error. We will correct this!

       - number: 2
         question: If the manifest.yaml is key for knowing what components are there, how "live" (aka "dynamic") can we be about adding components/plug-ins without being required to restart the Zowe server?
         answer: |
           
           At present time, adding components/plug-ins to the manifest.yaml will require a restart of the [corresponding] Zowe server. We will plan to enhance Zowe to offer a more dynamic approach (i.e. automatically re-read the manifest.yaml for any server that can handle changes without requiring a restart).

       - number: 3
         question: We deploy 40+ unique deployments at the same time. Each includes its own ZOWE deploy. We do this by changing the STC name. Can we still do that?
         answer: |
           
           Yes, they can be defined in zowe.yaml as `zowe.setup.security.stcs` which lets you set their names, e.g. `zowe.setup.security.stcs.zowe: ZWEMYSTC`.

       - number: 4
         question: We currently have to modify the various install scripts to change specific dataset names to accomplish this multiple-run scenario. Will we be able to do this?
         answer: |
           
           Yes, all data set names used by Zowe are configurable in zowe.yaml so you can configure your multiple-run scenario with multiple zowe.yaml files where each has its own stc and data set names.

       - number: 5
         question: If PARMLIB is used, can we consider eliminating zowe.yaml?
         answer: |
           
           Allowing PARMLIB doesn't change the way how Zowe uses zowe.yaml behind the scene. It's more like a new user interface to configure Zowe. The content in PARMLIB will be concatenated, merged into a temporary zowe.yaml and fed to Zowe. That means it won't change the way how components / extensions read configurations. On the other side, since we may enhance the configuration interface like allowing PARMLIB, it's not recommended for a component installer to read or update zowe.yaml directly. Instead, a component installer should read `ZWE_` environment variables to understand configurations, and use relevant zwe commands or library functions to update. For example, `zwe components enable` can be used to enable your component, and it's compatible with both USS zowe.yaml or PARMLIB configuration.

       - number: 6
         question: We are very concerned about the new requirement "must use the “P” command to terminate Zowe instead of “C” to cancel because some users may simply use C out of habit. Can you review this decision with IBM and possibly consider an alternative?
         answer: |
           
           We can review with IBM - that said, we also have plans to help prevent accidental “C”- cancel commands. Why did we do this? Zowe components need specific resource and recovery management handling - the “P” command sends the proper signal to Zowe to ensure all components are shut down appropriately. We'll investigate this more so many thanks for the feedback.

       - number: 7
         question: When will the pre-GA V2 Zowe package be available?

     questions: 
       - number: 1
         question: I want to ensure my Zowe extensions function with both V1 and V2.  What’s the best approach?  Provide two versions of my extension (one supporting each release) OR can an extender determine which LTS version of Zowe they are interacting with and offer one version that supports both?
         answer: |
           
           We recommend extensions create a dedicated package for Zowe v2 - this is the most straight-forward way to address all of the breaking changes. We recognize this presents the challenge of maintaining 2 sets of packages. If you prefer not to maintain 2 sets of packages, we believe it's possible to maintain one version of an extension which works for both Zowe v1 and v2. However, the lifecycle code will be complicated - comprehensive testing should be performed.

           **PLEASE BE AWARE** The Zowe V2 app framework desktop upgraded from angular version 6 to angular version 12 for support & security -  websites have  a “1 version of a library”  limitation.  This means that *plugins dependent upon angular must be coded for either v6 or v12* [not both] thus **the single version approach is not applicable.**

           If the lifecycle scripts are the main concern, the following steps outline requirements and our recommendations for the single version approach:

           1. Package manifest.yaml is required. This is a hard requirement for Zowe v2. If you define lifecycle scripts with default names, for example, use bin/start.sh as `commands.start`, it should work for v1.
           2. Revisit all environment variables used in the lifecycle scripts and apply fallback variables. For example, if you use $ROOT_DIR in Zowe v1, this should be changed to ${ZWE_zowe_runtimeDirectory:-${ROOT_DIR}} to make it compatible with both versions. Other variables like $EXPLORER_HOST should be changed to ${ZWE_haInstance_hostname:-${EXPLORER_HOST}} or ${ZWE_externalDomains_0:-${EXPLORER_HOST}} based on purpose.
           3. A Zowe v2 recommendation is defining extension configurations in the  manifest.yaml "configs" section and use ${ZWE_configs_*} variables to access them. This feature does not exist in Zowe v1. So if you use ${ZWE_configs_*} variables, it should fall back to the matching environment variable used in v1.
           4. For installation, Zowe v2 recommends defining a "commands.install" lifecycle script to handle Extension installation. This lifecycle script will be executed by `zwe components install`. In v1, this also exists if the end-user uses zowe-install-components.sh utility to install an Extension. So if we consider one Extension package working for both Zowe v1 and v2, this install lifecycle script should also be compatible with both v1 and v2. Or consider instructing the user to not use zowe-install-components.sh with Zowe v1.
           5. As discussed in slack, a new v2 variable ${ZWE_VERSION} may help you determine if the user is using Zowe v2 or v1. This variable does not exist in Zowe v1.
             - By knowing the Zowe version, the lifecycle scripts can implement logic to source v1 or v2 dedicated scripts to avoid handling fallbacks in the same script. This could be a cleaner way to avoid complicated compatibility version checks, and it could be easier in the future should you decide to drop Zowe v1 support.
           6. We are planning to release a comprehensive “migration guidance” section on docs.zowe.org to help Extenders facing these challenges.  Your feedback on this section is greatly appreciated.

     questions: 
       - number: 1
         question: With respect to the use of keyrings / certificates and certificate authentication - what happens if a personal certificate is not supplied / not used?  
         answer: |
           
           The API-ML uses the first certificate found in the keyring if the details about the certificate aren't supplied

       - number: 2
         question: Is there a quick and easy way for a User to see all of the registered UI endpoints to determine if they’ve been successfully registered?
         answer: |
           
           "Not really, if properly onboarded, they would be mentioned in the Swagger DOC but you’d have to first locate the appropriate tile (via the API catalog); There is a feature/request in the backlog that may satisfy this request - if you would like this prioritized please review and upvote this github issue: [https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/647](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/647) and possibly [https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1129](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1129)"

       - number: 3
         question: Is there a way to determine when the API-ML is entirely available vs. just some of the services?  (i.e. we are looking for a WTO message to write automation rules)
         answer: |
           
           'There are several ways to confirm API-ML is ”up and running”:'

           - Manually via the catalog, all services will show “green”
           - And endpoint is available for API access that can be leveraged for automation use-cases
           - 'There is a feature/request in the backlog for a WTO message - if you would like this prioritized please review and upvote this github issue: [https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1633](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/1633)'

         question: What are the mainframe password use cases that are not yet managed by the API-ML User Interface?
         answer: |
           
           The main use case we were unable to address due to technical limitations is the ability to detect an upcoming expiration and immediately offer a password change action, ahead of the actual expiration event. We have two other password change related enhancements as yet unplanned. Please review and upvote if you would like these prioritized: [https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2020](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2020) and [https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2018](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2018).

         question: We have configured static services with passtickets and are interested in a quick and easy way to confirm they have been configured correctly.  Does the API-ML offer a capability that allows a user or administrator to verify passticket configuration?
         answer: |
           
           No. There is a feature/request in the backlog for such a capability - if you would like this prioritized please review and upvote this github issue: [https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/647](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/647) and also consider this one:  [https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2059](https://github.com/zowe/api-layer/issues/2059)

     questions: 
       - number: 1
         question: How do the Zowe CLI features (like Team Config) impact VS Code offerings that include Zowe client technologies i.e. CLI & Explorer?
         answer: |
           
           VS Code extensions and code pack solutions that rely on the Zowe Explorer (mainframe files and jobs) are interested in and have added capabilities that leverage Team Config.  Recommend attending/reviewing the Zowe Explorer V2 office hours (scheduled for 4/20) for further details.

   - name: VS Code Explorer for Users Frequently Asked Questions
     id: questions-explorers-users
     questions: 
       - number: 1
         question: What is the authentication experience for Users who have already stored their USER & PASSWORD in a profile and then they (or their Administrator) has configured an API Mediation Layer service login afterwards?  I.e. When the user logs out and then tries to login again, will Zowe Explorer fall back to the original USER & PASSWORD experience or prompt for a token?
         answer: |
           
           If USER & PASSWORD are already stored in profiles for authentication and the User tries to use a token for login, Zowe Explorer will issue a message indicating *“This profile does not support token authentication”*.  In order to enable token authentication the SECURE array in the the configuration file (*either zowe.config.user.json* OR *zowe.config.json*) needs to be updated with tokenValue in place of USER & PASSWORD.   Default authentication is USER & PASSWORD

       - number: 2
         question: Does Zowe Explorer offer any visual indicator (i.e. an icon or decoration) that helps the user to understand which method of authentication is being used?
         answer: |
           
           No, there is no visual / decoration indicating authentication method.  In general if USER & PASSWORD is configured, the User will be prompted for them.

       - number: 3
         question: In addition to support for Team Config (replacement for profiles) are there other distinct Zowe Explorer features that may impact the User experience in Zowe V2?
         answer: |
           
           The Zowe Explorer (for VS Code) Squad has added usability features throughout the Zowe V1 (continuous delivery) LTS release, including adding commands and functions to process multiple items, adding progress bars, and refresh capabilities.  The comprehensive list of features can be viewed in the changelog at the VS Code Marketplace: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/Zowe.vscode-extension-for-zowe/changelog](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/Zowe.vscode-extension-for-zowe/changelog) ; it is important to note that a new LTS release gives all squads the opportunity to introduce changes that may require an upgrade or result in a significant change in behavior - the Zowe community refers to these as “breaking changes”.  In the case of Zowe V2 LTS, the significant change for Zowe Explorer is the introduction of and support for Team Profile Configurations & setting updates as well as. 

       - number: 4
         question: After Zowe V2 is introduced, will I automatically obtain the V2 LTS version of Zowe Explorer?
         answer: |
           
           Provided the User has not changed the auto update (extensions.autoUpdate) default setting in their Zowe Explorer USER SETTINGS to false, Zowe Explorer will automatically be updated to V2.  If the auto update setting has been changed to “false”, the user can decide when to update Zowe Explorer - they do this manually by clicking the “UPDATE” button. (The UPDATE button will show once Zowe V2 LTS is available).

       - number: 5
         question: Who is expected to configure the "Team" profiles? 
         answer: |
           
           Ideally, for Team Configuration a designated Administrator who has access to the appropriate connection information and is familiar with configuring profiles - this will enable developers to get started with Zowe Explorer without having to learn about profiles and will ensure all developers are configured with their organizations required authentication policy.
